iOSImageHelper
==============

An iOS helper library to make creating/converting/compositing images a little easier.


This is a small collection of methods that make converting to/from CGImage, UIImage, and CIImage a little easier.
It also includes methods to rotate images arbitrary angles, compositing CGImages together, and composite a UIView (with subviews) into UIImages.

Better documentation will come later, I promise.
